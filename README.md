# Heart Disease Prediction

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health metrics. The goal is to provide a reliable tool for early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health metrics, the model helps in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

# Project Overview
The project is structured to include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation. The final model can be used for predicting the presence of heart disease based on patient data.

# File Structure
* [Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/shrek-28/heart-disease-prediction/blob/main/Heart%20Disease%20Prediction.ipynb): The main Jupyter Notebook that contains all steps of the project, including data cleaning, feature selection, model building, and evaluation.
